I told lie against my will conscience
It's gaing to rain I'm afraid

無罪放免　皮肉嘲笑　僕は存在シテル

So why are you? suside him hate loose

He gaue uent to his anger in the speech
The judgement was against him

記憶の微やかな白紙のヒューバス
空回る水彩デッサンを
毒液で薄めて　夢中で舐め回した
硬直した生命が確かに動いた

Why are you so angly?
Answer me my question!!

Judgment the day of judgment

僕を食べれば黙る欲張りな法廷
罪と罰の甘いソテーで
うざい有罪
うんざり無罪

an error judgment
