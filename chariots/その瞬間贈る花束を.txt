I want to present this.
I want to present it now.
I want to present it to you.

the distance with the person who loves
distance in which mind feels rested
心と体の繋がりを
確かめ合いながらも君はすぐに

何時しか想い出に変わるとしても
もう一度君と手を重ねた

if suffering cannot be endured take my life
i suffering cannot be endured take your life
receive it. this feelings

駆け巡る駆け巡る駆け出してる
オレの中で生まれたメロディ
咲き乱れ咲き乱れ幸溢れて
君の顔も喜びと涙で溢れる

駆け巡る駆け巡る駆け出してるオレは
Because it doesn't separate your hand
咲き乱れ咲き乱れ幸溢れて君も
this bouquet importantly indefinitely
