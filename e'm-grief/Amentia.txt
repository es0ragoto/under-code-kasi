No one escapes from grief...

There is no likegood of fate turning in our favor.
The time when darkness, heavy with hurt, fades away will never come.
Meager hope is undermined by pessimistic thought.
We are always apt to overcome by the vexations.

Hey, did you hear ? I know a secret.
I hear that any salvation doesn't exist in this world.
As I would expect !
Don't freak out. It's no big deal.
We've been clued up on the fact that nobody can save us.
As I would expect.

「Take a deep breath. Don't be too hard on yourself.
Don't worry about anything, my dear.
The world is being covered with brigtness and affection.
You'll be able to work out the meaning of life without fail
You who believe will be saved.」

・・・That's easy to say !

I've had it ! I can't take it anymore.
We are fed up with the sorrow from the doom of all.

Bytt out ! ...Why am I on edge ? I'm at a loss.
With luck, we will be able to meet again.
Say *____ ___* to Fortune for me!
