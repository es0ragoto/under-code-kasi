My existence appears the existence of surroundings that damages the person in eyes
That damage me and reflecting scenery and spectacle appear to my presence
Beautifully and vividly like the current mind. 
 
Everything... It is not possible to hold in check of me... 
Rots away and it disappears in murderous intent and the illusion. 
Nature and I are changed into the another person. 
While being buried to the maze that leads somewhere of the dark. 
 
Let's awake. 
Taste of honey Voice
Break me who goes mad
 
夢は腐る
 
Let's awake
Taste of honey Voice
Break me who goes mad
 
夢は終わる
