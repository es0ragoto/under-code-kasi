Why are you make up?
Is a reason in it?
The PLACE I grew up here
Don't sully here

I know you're empty
Show me your 'VALUES'
There is a no reason
Why are you here?
I cannot put up with nausea
Cuz I vomit...

  meets meets safe safe safe eight G you dead U rail? U rail? U rail? So NONSENSE...

Why do you love the 'FAKE'?
Is a reason in it?
The love I want to it
But it dirty love...

Shout loudly for me!
[V-ROCK IS DEAD]
To fellows staining here
Die for the PLACE!

もうこれ以上染まりたくはない
吐き出す意味
shadow me...shadow me...for me...
もうこれ以上壊れたくはない
吐き出す理由
shadow me...shadow me...for me...
shadowy...shadowy...for the PLACE

Why am I still here?
Is a reason in it?
Why am I still here?
I wanna still sing here
