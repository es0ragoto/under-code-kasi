未遂に終わった自死の果てに深く抉れた傷が残る
麻酔はとうに意味を無くしまるで汚れた僕の様だ

無様だね何の為だろう？此処にも僕の居場所は無い…

うずき始めたこの亡骸の失くしたはずだった心の傷が
繋がれた鎖の先は心の中閉じ込めた君の翼に
絡みつく…

In the chaos,I hear a voice of a wriggling‘monster'
A monster will eat me before long

There are you and me in the separate world
However,you and I were chained together
I should have prayed for your happiness
But I have failed you

堕ちてゆく君を見つめて戻れるなら戻りたいよ…君と居た世界に
生まれゆく「怪物」は此処で形を変える心に涙涸らし藻掻いてる*

Was the ‘monster' born among me?
No,he is not yet born
Once again, was the ‘monster' born among me?
He is born soon...
