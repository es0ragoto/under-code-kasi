I'm crushed by you [death throes]
I'm frightened by you [death throes]
I'm raped by you [death throes]
And I...vomit
I'm destroyed by you [death throes]
I'm defeated by you [death throes]
I'm murdered by you [death throes]
And I commit suicide

You hurt my heart unconcernedly many times
You have it as pleasure
As for you, nothing knows me but intend to know it
Therefore I...

ただ叫び続けるこの理想と言う虚像を
求める灰の声に涙流しながら…

I cried in my heart
Many times many times...
And I decided to kill you

ただ叫び続けるもう全てがこの心に
突き刺す痛みだった誰もが敵で
否定の雨でさえも もう傘も差さずに
心に刻み続けるその貴様の声を
