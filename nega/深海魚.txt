ネガ／深海魚
I cry alone
Cry...Nobody notices it
I'm lonely eternally
I can live only here
I look up at the sea
But I see nothing
I swam to upper
But, I cannot live there

I hate myself...and have to die
I can't suicide suck in the XXX fuck in the XXX

I don't know my figure
Because, I see nothing
Can you see my figure?
How can you see me?
I mind it...
Am I beautiful
Am I very ugly?
Surely I'm awfully ugly

I hate myself...and have to die
I can't suicide suck in the XXX fuck in the XXX

この支配を超える闇　光の果て　泣いた過去でさえ　見えぬ君の姿
この未来を超える闇　光は果て　空廻る答え　空虚に浮かぶ理想は

I miss you...
この闇に消え

I hate myself...and have to die
I can't suicide suck in the XXX fuck in the XXX
I hate myself...and have to die
I don't undertsand even a living meaning

この支配を超える闇　光の果て　泣いたこの血さえ　届かぬ想いで染める
この未来を超える闇　光は果て　空廻る想い　理想はこの身と溺れ

泣いて…
