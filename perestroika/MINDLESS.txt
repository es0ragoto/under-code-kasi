I KNOW DISACCORD OF LOVE
I KNOW DISACCORD OF MIND
I KNOW DISACCORD OF SEX
I KNOW MINDLESS SEX

愛し合えぬ故に揺れ 思うが侭 快楽とDRUG SEX
I SEE... アガるこの気持ち 君とならSO VERY VERY MINDLESS SEX

傷口に口付けて這わす愛はAS MANY AS MY PAIN
今宵迷うこの身体 キメたのはSO...[M]AD [D]RUG [M]AD [A]CHE
I NEED YOUR BODY BUT NEED YOUR MIND? 愛よりもEXTASY DANCING
NO NO NO...脳裏に掠める記憶には触れないでDON'T TOUCH

LET'S GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL
TOO LATE THAT YOU DON'T NOTICE

I WANNA... KILL ME GENTLY IN THE BED
I WANNA KISS YOU. MINDLESS LOVER
I WANNA... KILL ME GENTLY IN THE BED
NOBODY KILLS ME GENTLY TONIGHT

妄想と不安に侵される 心はまだ抜け出せぬIN MAZE
代償は深く戻れない…夢の中またVERY VERY MINDLESS SEX

I could not but depend on it
Because, I can't be dependent on you
Even if dependent on you, it only hurts my heart
So I'm scary, that my heart is weak

You're already dead...
